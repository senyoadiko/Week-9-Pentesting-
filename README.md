# Week-9-Pentesting-
Time spent: 11 hours spent in total

Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

Username Enumeration
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
SQL Injection (SQLi)
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Session Hijacking/Fixation
Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

Blue
Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection - I first tried to do an injection with '1=1' which is what I always do. Then I went to other injections and the one that worked was worked was 'or sleep(7)=0--" 

Red
Vulnerability #1:I was logged into the green site as pperson and when I went to the menu and Sales people there were two interesting Sales people. Lazy Lazyman and Testy McTesterson so I clicked on show and found that they have id = 10 and 11. I went to the sites and put in there Id numbers. On the green and blue site, I couldn't see them. On the red site I could find them by putting their number at the top after I selected a sales person.

Green
Vulnerability #1: This was a cross-site scripting vunerability. I put a username and email in the contact area of the site. Then I did a XSS in the comment area. Logged into the site as pperson and clicked on feedback and I got sxx sign.
